## Project Overview

English | [PortuguÃªs](README_pt-br.md)

Welcome to the project that explores the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of fatal police shootings in the USA between the years 2015 to 2020. My goal is to extract valuable insights from the data through careful manipulation, and interpretation.

#### Data Sources
I will be utilizing the "fatal-police-shootings-data.csv" dataset, a comprehensive collection of data points related to fatal police shootings. Datasets available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/police-deadly-force-usage-us?select=fatal-police-shootings-data.csv).

#### Approach
My approach involves using Python's `Pandas` library for data manipulation and `SQL` (PostgreSQL) for database-related operations. This combination of tools enables us to effectively navigate and process the dataset.

## Explore the Analysis
For a sneak peek into the analysis, feel free to browse the [Project Notebook](/EDA-Fatal_Police_Shootings_USA.ipynb). This notebook provides a firsthand look into the steps I've taken to uncover insights and trends in fatal police shootings in the USA.
